# startpage
## A minimal start page in both form and function.

This is a personal startpage that is used as a replacement for the Home and New Tab pages in Firefox. It is hosted on a Raspberry Pi so it is designed to be lean while delivering links to my most visited websites.

**Features:**

- Minimal design that is not distracting
- Quick links to most visited websites
- Local weather that uses the OpenWeather API
- Optional searchbox located above the quick links
